# Project 2 Sentiment Driven Algotrader

## Project Proposal
This project is to utilize news sentiment to predict stock movement. The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) will generate positive sentiment that triggers buy signals of stock, and negative sentiment that triggers a sell signal of stock. The buy and sell signals will be combined in a portfolio of stocks and used to backtest and compare the results to the S&P 500. We will be sourcing our data from the Stock News Api and Yahoo Finance as our data sources. After a return ie generated from the portfolio machine learning algorithms will be run to predict future price of stock.
